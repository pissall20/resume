He is that one individual who wouldn't back out from accepting a challenge and would burn the midnight oil to get the product delivered right on time.  Not surprisingly enough, he has been the brightest star in the extremely talented small team at Cuddle.AI. I would highly recommend him for his work ethics and his never-say-die attitude.",
